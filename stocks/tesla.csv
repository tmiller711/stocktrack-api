which one of these is better:

1.
As a self-taught software engineer with 5 years of experience in programming, I have a strong foundation in
web development technologies including React, Django, and Python. Proficient in SQL and ORMs, as well as
Nginx, Git, and Linux, I have a diverse skill set that allows me to tackle a variety of projects. I have
experience with AWS and have developed a number of notable projects, including a full-featured video
streaming website using React and Django. In addition to my self-taught background, I have also
completed coursework in data science and machine learning, as well as computer science. As I am
passionate about continuing to learn and grow as a developer, I am always looking for new challenges and
opportunities to learn. I am excited to continue my career in software engineering and take on new
challenges.
